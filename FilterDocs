Alright, so the filters will look really goof, so here's an explanation on how they even do...

Here's a filter:

        {
            "Name": "National Level",
            "Originators":[
                "PEP", 
                "CIV"
            ],
            "EventCodes": [
                "EAN",
                "EAT",
                "NPT"
            ],
            "SameCodes":[
                "*"
            ],
            "CallSigns":[
                "*"
            ],
            "Action": "Relay:Forced"
        },

To explain this fiter, We have to look at the basics:
Name, Originators, EventCodes, SameCodes, CallSigns, Action.

           Name: The name of the filter, Human readable. This will only be used to log/print the matching filters.
    Originators: The matching Originator Codes (EAN, PEP, CIV, WXR, EAS) To trigger the filter by Originator.
     EventCodes: The matching Event Codes to trigger the filter.
      SameCodes: The SAME Code (With subdivision) that will trigger the filter.
      CallSigns: Optional, Special Callsigns (E.G. Filter out ERN/JON as log only)
         Action: What the filter will do in response to activation.

I think most of that is self-explanitory, but the Action needs more definition:

    Available Actions:
        Relay, Ignore, Manual (Manual not implemented yet)
    Available Action Defs:
        Forced, Now, <Number> Log

The Format is "Action:Def" in which you tell the ENDEC if you want to relay or not, and what to do and when after that.
E.G. "Relay:Now" Relays the alert immediately after catching. Any Ignore action wil completely ignore the alert, except
Ignore:Log, which will Log the Reciept.
An Action with a number in the DEF slot will treat that as a timer in seconds, up to 1 hour (3600 Seconds):
E.G. "Relay:60" will wait 60 seconds (1 Minute) before relaying the alert.
Note, Please do not set a timer on an Ignore, as this can and will cause filter issues. Use Manual Instead (When implemented).

Important: The character "*" is used as a wildcard in the "Originators", "EventCodes", "SameCodes", and "CallSigns" areas.
Using this character will cause the filter to disreguard that section, and treat it as a matched filter.
E.G. If you set "CallSigns" to "*", or have "*" ANYWHERE in "CallSigns", "CallSigns" will always be matched.

That's pretty much the basics of the new filter system.
ok thx bye
